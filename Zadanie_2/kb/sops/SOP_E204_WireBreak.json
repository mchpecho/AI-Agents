    "Secure the machine: confirm STOP and wait for all drives to come to a complete halt.",
    "Visually inspect the wire path and break location (guides, pulleys, winding).",
    "Remove wire residue from hazardous areas (guides, rollers, spool).",
    "Check tension setting (Tension_N) and look for mechanical damage.",
    "Re-thread the wire according to standard path; verify attachment to the spool.",
    "Start slowly (low LineSpeed_mpm) and monitor Tension_N + SpoolRPM for 1–2 minutes.",
    "If E204 recurs, reduce speed and escalate to maintenance (possible damage to guides/pulleys)."
