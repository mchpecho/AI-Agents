  "steps": [
    "Reduce line speed (LineSpeed_mpm) by 10–30% and monitor whether SlipDetected stops.",
    "Check feed roller pressure: contamination, wear, oil, or dust.",
    "Verify that Tension_N is within normal range (low tension promotes slip).",
    "Check spool RPM synchronization (SpoolRPM) and winding smoothness.",
    "If slip persists, stop and perform cleaning and adjustment.",
    "After intervention, test at lower speed and gradually return to setpoint."

  "body": "Slip can cause inconsistent quality and increased risk of E204."
